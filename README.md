# brain-dashboard

## Setup & Installation

1. **Create and activate a virtual environment (Python 3.12 recommended):**
   ```bash
   python3.12 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **(Recommended) Install the package in editable mode:**
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

## Running the Folder Watcher

You can run the folder watcher in two ways:

### 1. As a CLI tool (recommended)
After installing the package (step 3 above), run:
```bash
watch-folder --folder brain_dashboard/data --interval 30
```
- `--folder` : Folder to watch for new files (default: value from `settings.py)`)
- `--interval` : Polling interval in seconds (default: 30)

### 2. As a Python module
```bash
python -m brain_dashboard.scripts.admin_app 
python -m brain_dashboard.scripts.run_app 
python -m brain_dashboard.scripts.watch_folder
```

## Packaging
This project uses [PEP 621](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/) and `pyproject.toml` for modern Python packaging. The CLI entry point `watch-folder` is provided for convenience.
